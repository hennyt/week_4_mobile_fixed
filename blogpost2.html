    <h1> Notes From an Island of Stickies: The K-J Method and Math Education</h1>
    <a name="top"></a>
    <p>I was hardly a grad student before I was introduced to the K-J method. The <a href "https://asq.org/quality-resources/affinity"> K-J method </a> is an artifact of an article published in the late 90's and, while some elements of the original article are problematic, the method remains an integral part of the Information student's curriculum. The method is attributed to a Japanese ethnologist, Jiro Kawakita. It is situated within a framework for analyzing and grouping information gathered, and most commonly used to facilitate problem-solving. In some ways, you can think of it as a <a href "https://flaviocopes.com/dom/"> DOM tree </a> for natural relationship grouping.</p>

    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get a group together</li>
      <li>Define the bounds of the problem to be solved</li>
      <li>Write (many) ideas on (many) yellow sticky notes</li>
      <li>Put the sticky notes on a wall or other flat surface</li>
      <li>Sort the yellow sticky notes into groups - aim for no more than 5 per cluster</li>
      <li>Over each cluster of yellow stickies, place a blue sticky with a one- or two-sentence summary of the yellow notes in the cluster</li>
      <li>Form the clusters into meta-clusters</li>
      <li>Over each meta-cluster, place a pink sticky with a one- or two-sentence summary of the meta-cluster</li>
      <li>If you have more than 6 pink stickies, form the meta-clusters into meta-meta-clusters</li>
      <li>Over each meta-meta cluster, place a green sticky with a one-or two-sentence summary of the meta-meta-cluster</li>
      <li>If needed, align notes to clarify hierarchical relationships, space things out, etc.</li>
      <li>Take a picture for posterity! See results below:</li>
    </ol>

    <p> The true joy of the K-J Method is in its organizational power. It asserts that the solution to a problem can be derived from information already uncovered  - that the true problem is an organizational one. There is something touching about this assertion, as if all the problems in the world could be solved by shuffling sticky notes into the correct order. It wasn't until I was reading Jerome Bruner's <a href "http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/bruner.html"> Culture of Education </a> for an Education class I'm taking that the beautiful simplicity of the K-J Method struck me again. Bruner discusses "the messy, ambiguous, and context-sensitive processes of meaning-making", arguing that "perspectives [are] fused into some congruent unity, recognized as parts of a common continent." In fact, he goes on to claim that, having learned basic addition, a child has all the knowledge they need to derive laws of multiplication and logarithms. This recalled to me both the K-J Method and a conversation I had had with a friend about meaning-making in mathematics. </p>

    <p>My friend expressed an interesting question - that if <a href "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd06xx/EWD641.PDF"> programming is essentially math </a>, and if she hates math, then should she take more programming classes? She went on to confide in me that she was afraid that, should she continue to take advanced programming classes, the math would come through and everything would collapse in on itself - unlearnable after all.  Her question was easy to dismiss from outside appearances: she earned an A in both programming classes she has taken so far. But it was harder to dismiss on a personal level.  The fear of unknowing things, the questioning of where new learning might take us, is something which all students know. But if Bruner is right and we learn new things by applying structure to what we already know, then does the learning process become simpler, or less alarming - even in a subject we thought we hated?  Perhaps, perhaps not. The learning process can still feel stilted and unnatural: it is the rare child who spontaneously forms the relationship between the integers 8 and 3. But in my friend's case, it did help. As she said, "programming is different. If it's math, it just makes sense this time." Contexts do matter when problem-solving - or as the professor who taught me the K-J Method is fond of saying, information changes everything. </p>
