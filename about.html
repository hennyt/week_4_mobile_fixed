      <p>Hello! My name is Henny Tasker and I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan concentrating in UX Research and Design, with a secondary focus on Human-Computer Interaction. I love learning about people's passions! What makes a person excited about new technology and ways of doing things? What makes a person dread change? How do people learn online?</p>

      <p>I hold degrees in History, Museum Studies, and New Media Writing. My career started in the Philippines, where I spent a yearÂ teaching English and computer literacy as a Peace Corps Volunteer. Back stateside, I worked as an Instructional Designer in Higher Education. These experiences have left me with a desire to explore diverse online learning environments and to design computer systems for the variety of ways in which people learn.</p>
